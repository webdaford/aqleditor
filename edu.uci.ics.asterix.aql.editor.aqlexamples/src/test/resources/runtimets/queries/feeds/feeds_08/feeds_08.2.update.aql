                  Create a dataset that has an associated ngram index.
                  The synthetic feed simulator uses the Social-Data generator to generate data and simulate a feed.
                  The feed lasts a configured duration with data arriving at a configured rate (tweets per second).
                  Verify the existence of data after the feed finishes.
