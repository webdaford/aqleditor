/*
 * Description  : Create a feed dataset and a feed using the generic socket feed adaptor.
                  To drive the socket adaptor based feed, we define another feed using the
                  client socket test adaptor. Content from the file is read by the test adaptor
                  and forwarded to the socket feed adaptor that is listening at a known socket.
                  At the end, data is collected in the dataset that was fed by the socket feed adaptor.
                  Verify the existence of data in the dataset.

 * Expected Res : Success
 * Date         : 20th Nov 2013
