 * Description    : Left-outer joins two datasets, DBLP and CSX, based on their title.
 *                  DBLP has a secondary btree index on title, and given the 'indexnl' hint 
 *                  we expect the join to be transformed into an indexed nested-loop join.
 *
 *					TODO(@Sattam): given the 'indexnl' hint 
 *                  we expect the join to be transformed into an indexed nested-loop join.
 *					
 *					regression test 2 for issue 285--having an order by and limit for the outer loop relation
 *
 * Success        : Yes
