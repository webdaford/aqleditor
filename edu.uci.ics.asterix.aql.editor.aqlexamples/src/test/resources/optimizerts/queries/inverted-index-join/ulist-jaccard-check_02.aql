/*
 * Description    : Fuzzy joins two datasets, Customer and Customer2, based on the similarity-jaccard-check function of their interest sets.
 *                  Customers2 has a keyword index on interests, and we expect the join to be transformed into an indexed nested-loop join.
 * Success        : Yes
